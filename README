This script describes similarities between the KEGG annotations of multiple genomes.  For example, genome A and B are run through KEGG.  Using those KEGG results, this script tells you...
  * that A and B both have gene X, but only A has gene Y.  
  * that gene X is located in the same position in both A and B (unimplemented)
